# IT 533 â€“ Week 2 Lab Assignment
# Author: Nicholas Summerlee
# Description:
# This program demonstrates variable assignment, string manipulation,
# string formatting techniques, numeric operations, and use of the math module.
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#1 Stores first
my_firstname_lower = "nicholas" 
#2 Stores last name
my_lastname_UPPER = "SUMMERLEE"
#3 Print Hello, and concatenante the flipped casing structre with .upp() and .lower()
print (f"Hello, {my_firstname_lower.upper()} {my_lastname_UPPER.lower()}")
# 4 Print two new lines
print("\n\n")
# 5 Creates a new variable that stores your first and last name together with a space between both parts.
my_full_name = f"{my_firstname_lower} {my_lastname_UPPER}"
# 6 Slice out the last name with .find(" ") +1:
print(my_full_name[my_full_name.find(" ") + 1:])
# 7 Replaces your last name in the variable you created in step 5 with "<your last name>, 
# Walsh College Student"; print out the new value of this variable.
update_name = my_full_name.replace(my_lastname_UPPER, f"{my_lastname_UPPER}, Walsh College Student")
# 8 Print quote 
print(update_name)

print(""""Start by doing whats necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible - Francis of Assisi" """)
# 9 Stores 2 decimal numbers as variables.
num1 = 69.1234
num2 = 45.5678
#10 Stores one addition, one subtraction, one multiplication, and one division operation of these variables as variables.
add = num1+num2
sub = num1-num2
mult = num1*num2
div = num1/num2
# 11 Prints out each of the four results as:
# <numeric value of variable 1> plus <numeric value of variable 2> equals <value of variable that stored the result of addition>
# <numeric value of variable 1> minus <numeric value of variable 2> equals <value of variable that stored the result of subtraction>
# ...etc. Each output should be on its own line and utilize a different technique for displaying the requested information 
# (concatenation, string formatting expressions, string formatting method calls, f-Strings).
import math
#Concatenate format
print(str(num1) + " + " + str(num2) + " = " + str(add)) 
#String formatting expression
print ("%s - %s = %s" % (num1,num2,sub))
#String format Call to .format
print("{} x {} = {}".format(num1,num2,mult))
#f-string format
print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {div}")
# 12 Creates a new variable called sq_root that stores the square root of the variable that holds the 
# result of the multiplication operation you performed in step 10 to two decimal places. Print out this value as:
# The square root of <value of variable that stored the result of multiplication> equals <the variable you 
# just calculated for this step>
# You may pick your own method for displaying this information.
sqrt = round(math.sqrt(mult), 2)
print(f"The square root of {mult} = {sqrt}")
# Stores the current month as a string variable (e.g. March, June, etc.) and day of the month as a numeric variable.
month = "October"
day = 11
#Outputs "Today is day <day of month> of the month of <month variable>." This should be on a new line and tabbed 
# over two times. You may pick your own method for displaying this information, but it should be different than the 
# technique you used in step 12.
print ("\n\t\tToday is day", str(day), "of the month", month + ".")
